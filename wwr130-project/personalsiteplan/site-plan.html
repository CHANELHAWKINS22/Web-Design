        While on our site one could scroll through our various climbing equipment so they could learn more about the sport they love! We have extensive explanations of various climbing gear and photos to go with it so you can learn everything there is to know about the gear you are researching.Our site is split into two main categories. Category one is indoor climbing and category two is outdoor climbing. It is important to know that many outdoor and indoor climbing gear overlaps so you may find the same gear on both pages. We also organized our gear into difficulty levels. At the tops of our pages are beginning climbing gear, or what we like to call, the basics. The basics are the gear that every climber needs to have a great and successful climb. Then it moves on the moderate. These are the gear that opens new pathways to climb and makes your experience more comfortable and enjoyable while adding an extra layer of safety. Then we have the expert gear. This type of gear will be towards the bottom of our site pages. This gear is leaned more towards more of the extreme climbers who need the gear for specific climbs. The gear adds extra safety while opening new ways to indoor or outdoor climbing.
